Installation
------------
Simply place the index.html and script.js files into the same folder to see the randomization effect in motion.


Detailed Explaination
-----------
**This is designed to randomize only single letters and not full length words.**

How does it work? 

* Select the html element you want the alpha changing animation to end on.* 

* Select the html element that will do the alpha changing animation.* 

* As you scroll, you'll noticed the background color slowly fades to solid depending on how far your element is from the alpha element.
